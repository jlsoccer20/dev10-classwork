#Gomoku Plan

## Requirements

- Can set up two players.
For a human player, collect their name. (A random player's name is randomly generated.)
For each stone placement, use the player's name to ask questions.
Since the random player doesn't require input, the UI should display stone placement and the results of placement. (Random player placement may fail since they don't know what they're doing.)
Re-prompt on failed placement. The game must not proceed until a player has made a valid move.
Display the final result of the game.
Give the option to play again.
